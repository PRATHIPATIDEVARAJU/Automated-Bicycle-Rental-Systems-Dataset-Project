# Automated-Bicycle-Rental-Systems-Dataset-Project

## Dataset Description

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

This dataset contains information related to the demand for bicycle rentals in a city. It is designed to analyze and predict bicycle rental patterns based on various environmental and temporal factors. 

## Dataset Description

|  Column Name	|  Description |
|---------------|--------------|
|  __instant__  |	Unique identifier for each record in the dataset. |
|  __dteday__  |	Date of the record in YYYY-MM-DD format. |
|  __season__ |	Categorical variable indicating the season (1: Winter, 2: Spring, 3: Summer, 4: Fall). |
| __yr__  |	Year of the record (0 = 2011, 1 = 2012). |
| __mnth__  |	Month of the record (1 to 12). |
| __holiday__ |	Binary variable indicating if the day is a holiday (1 = Yes, 0 = No). |
| __weekday__ |	Integer representing the day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday).|
| __workingday__ }	Binary variable indicating if the day is a working day (1 = Yes, 0 = No). |
| __weathersit__  |	Categorical variable for weather situation (1: Clear, 2: Mist + Cloudy, etc.).|
| __temp__ |	Normalized temperature in Celsius. |
| __atemp__  |	Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. |
| __hum__  |	Normalized humidity as a percentage (0-100%). |
| __windspeed__ |	Normalized wind speed in m/s. |
| __casual__ |	Count of non-registered users who rented bicycles on that day. |
| __registered__ |	Count of registered users who rented bicycles on that day.|
| __cnt__ |	Total count of bicycle rentals (casual + registered) for that day. |

## Purpose of the Analysis

The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the factors influencing bicycle rental demand and to build predictive models that can estimate future rentals based on environmental and temporal variables. By understanding these relationships, city planners and bike-sharing services can make informed decisions to improve services and infrastructure.


## Technologies Used

This project utilizes various Python libraries, including:

- __NumPy__ : For numerical operations and data manipulation.

- __Pandas__ : For data handling and analysis.

- __Matplotlib__ : For data visualization.

- __Seaborn__ : For statistical data visualization.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the bicycle rental dataset reveals key factors influencing rental demand, such as seasonal variations, weather conditions, and the distinction between casual and registered users. Understanding these patterns helps city planners and bike-sharing services optimize fleet management and marketing strategies. Future work could focus on developing predictive models to forecast demand and enhance service offerings.
